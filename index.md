# Hello! Welcome to my website.

## Introduction

My name is **initdg** (or _dev_ for short). New to the world of computer science, my aim is to explore the possibilities available to me through this formidable enigma known as the web.
I hope to progress through my self-study of java and exploration of machine learning in the near future.

What exactly is Computer Science? [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) is an answer by some of my fellow internet folk.

## About Me

### Things I like:

- drinking earl grey tea with a long novel in hand and a cat on my lap
- solving puzzles of the Sherlock Holmes or Professor Layton sort
- diving into questionable ocean waters on a cold day
- learning new languages (of human and computers)

```markdown
My experience with `coding`:

1. Python
2. HTML

```

## Moving forward

P.S. Everything is composed of 0's and 1's (**mindblown**)
