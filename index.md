# Hello! Welcome to my github site.

## Introduction

My name is **initdg** (or _dev_ for short). New to the world of computer science, my aim is to explore the possibilities available to me through this formidable enigma known as the web.
I hope to progress through my self-study of java and exploration of machine learning in the near future.

What exactly is Computer Science? [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) is an answer by some of my fellow internet folk:

**My experience with `coding`**:

1. Python
2. HTML

```

## About Me

### Things I like:

- drinking earl grey tea with a long novel in hand and a cat on my lap
- learning new languages (of the human and computer sort)
- solving puzzles like those of the Sherlock Holmes or Professor Layton sort
- diving into questionable ocean waters on a cold day

### On the other hand...

I am not fond of people who say one thing and do another, lack of clarity, and the moments in time I find myself losing my sense of ambition. Or when my tea loses its heat.

## Moving forward
I am not quite sure how I hope to build upon this website but I will return to it every so often. Maybe years from now, I will look upon this as a starting point.

I'll add an image below later...
